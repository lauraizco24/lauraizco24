## **About Me**

I am an Aeronautical Engineer, with experience in the design and operation of UAVs (Drones), I also have experience in the area of aerial image processing for the creation of maps. I am currently venturing into the world of programming, I have knowledge in the FrontEnd area, but now I am specializing in the Backend, specifically with JAVA. I am a self-taught person, and I love learning new things.

I am currently working on:

An API that simulates the Netflix system.:film_strip:
Later I will start doing the FrontEnd part of it.:tv:
